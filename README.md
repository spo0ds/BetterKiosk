# Improved Kiosk Implementation (Better Kiosk)

This repository showcases a refined version of the Kiosk concept,
aiming to provide a more user-friendly and flexible experience for both kiosk owners and item owners.

## Addressing Limitations in Traditional Kiosks

Traditional kiosk implementations may encounter limitations such as:

- Item Inaccessibility: NFTs listed on a kiosk might remain unavailable for purchase if they don't attract a buyer.
- Listing Dependency: Item owners may face restrictions if kiosk owners choose not to list their items actively.
- Limited Price Control: Item owners might have less control over the pricing of their items within a kiosk.

## Better Kiosk: Enhanced Flexibility and Control

This Better Kiosk implementation addresses these limitations by offering:

- Item Relinquishment: Item owners can remove their items from a specific kiosk if they remain unpurchased, allowing them to potentially list them on other kiosks.
- Independent Control: Item owners have the ability to withdraw their items from a kiosk if the kiosk owner chooses not to list them for sale.
- Price Negotiation: Item owners retain greater control over the pricing of their items, while kiosk owners can adjust listing prices to potentially maximize profit.

## Disclaimer

Better Kiosk is currently an experimental project proposed by Spo0ds and should be used with caution in production environments. While designed with functionality and security in mind, we recommend conducting thorough testing and assessments before deploying it in real-world applications.
